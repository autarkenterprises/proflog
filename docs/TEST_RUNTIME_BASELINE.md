# Test Runtime Baseline

Branch: `adr-0009-legacy-program-closure`

This document records the duration of the final successful iteration used to
promote a test into the committed greenfield suite. Timings are intentionally
kept as observed wall-clock measurements from the exact successful run that
justified the test.

## Committed Test Iterations

| Test var | Namespace | Query family | Final successful runtime | Notes |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| `decomposition-can-bind-earlier-arguments-before-finding-a-later-clash` | `proflog.equality-test` | `exists a,b,t. [1] = cons(a, cons(b, t))` | `422.261319 ms` | Regression for contradiction discovered only after an earlier parameter binding during equality decomposition. |
| `factored-move-warning-leaves-small-win-positions-unresolved` | `proflog.query-test` | Ground `move/2` plus factored-vs-inline `win/1` | `4226.645269 ms` | Direct proof search still decides ground `move/2`; bounded status leaves factored `win(0)` and `win(1)` unresolved. |
| `acyclic-quantified-spec-distinguishes-acyclic-and-cyclic-small-graphs` | `proflog.quantified-programs-test` | `acyclic-abc`, `acyclic-aba`, `acyclic-abca` | `2400.870986 ms` | Inline graph-property quantifiers prove the acyclic graph and refute the cyclic ones. |
| `subset-quantified-spec-handles-true-false-and-reflexive-cases` | `proflog.quantified-programs-test` | `sub-ab-abc`, `sub-abc-ab`, `sub-a-a` | `2154.439012 ms` | Quantified finite-domain subset specification closes both true cases and refutes the false one. |
| `member-empty-list-fails` | `proflog.list-programs-test` | `member(a, [])` | `565.030374 ms` | Immediate constructor-clash failure after opening the existential list shape. |
| `append-two-step-ground-case-succeeds` | `proflog.list-programs-test` | `append([a, b], [c], [a, b, c])` | `154219.489533 ms` | Required fuel `256`; semantically closed but expensive. |
| `append-forward-query-binds-a-three-element-result` | `proflog.list-programs-test` | `append([a], [b, c], z)` | `68873.149268 ms` | Concrete three-element result exported at call-depth `2`; shallow `neq` residuals remain. |
| `reverse-two-element-list-succeeds` | `proflog.list-programs-test` | `reverse([a, b], [b, a])` | `276769.773115 ms` | Required fuel `256`; recursive reverse remains materially slower than append. |
| `append-nested-forward-query-binds-the-concrete-result` | `proflog.list-programs-test` | `append([[a]], [[b]], z)` | `41655.620203 ms` | Concrete nested binding exported at call-depth `2`; shallow `neq` residuals remain. |
| `append-nested-suffix-query-binds-the-concrete-second-argument` | `proflog.list-programs-test` | `append([[a, b]], z, [[a, b], [c]])` | `26539.838541 ms` | Concrete nested suffix exported at call-depth `2`; shallow `neq` residuals remain. |

## Exploratory Runtime Boundaries

| Probe | Final successful runtime | Result | Operational note |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `append(xs, ys, [a, b, c])` answer enumeration | `1372558.603771 ms` | Returned only 2 answer records | Base split plus first recursive split family only; inverse list enumeration remains a major performance gap. |
| `reverse([a, b], r)` answer synthesis | `>300000 ms` | No result before manual stop | Reverse synthesis is still materially worse than ground reverse truth checking. |
| Nested `append(x, y, [[a], [b]])` split enumeration | `>180000 ms` | No result before manual stop | Even the short nested inverse family remains operationally expensive. |
| Depth-3 forward `append(left, right, z)` answer synthesis | `>360000 ms` | No result before manual stop | Structural depth alone is enough to make open answer export impractical right now. |
| `sorted2([1])` complementary failure search | `>120000 ms` | No result before manual stop | The singleton sortedness case is currently neither closing as true nor quickly refuting as false. |
